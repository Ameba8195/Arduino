/*
  This sketch shows how to use GPIO interrupt and doing task in interrupt handler

  At first we light on LED.
  As button pin meets voltage rise signal, then interrupt happen and invoke interrupt handler.
  Then we change LED state.
      If LED was light on, then turn it off.
      If LED was light off, then turn it on.
