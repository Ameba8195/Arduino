/*
 * This sketch demonstrates the use of flash memory
 * 
 * Ameba's flash memory can be edit in a unit of sector which has size of 
 * 4K bytes.
 *
 * To read data from flash memory, we can just read it.
 *
 * To write data to flash memory, each bit on flash memory can only change
 * from '1' to '0' and it cannot change from '0' to '1'. To make sure the
 * data are correctly written we do erase flash memory sector before write
 * data on it.
 * 
 * This sketch store boot count in flash. Each time device boot up, it read
 * boot count from flash, add one, and write back to flash.
